### Which config file should I use?
There are two config files in this repository, `alacritty.yml` and `alacritty.toml`.
In most cases, you should use `alacritty.toml` because this is what most newer versions of Alacritty support. However, for my Debian install, I personally need to use `alacritty.yml`.
